Doc Text:
A SQL-injection vulnerability was found in openstack-ironic-inspector's node_cache.find_node(). This function makes a SQL query using unfiltered data from a server reporting inspection results (by a POST to the /v1/continue endpoint). Because the API is unauthenticated, the flaw could be exploited by an attacker with access to the network on which ironic-inspector is listening. Because of how ironic-inspector uses the query results,  it is unlikely that data could be obtained. However, the attacker could pass malicious data and create a denial of service.

Description
Summer Long

There is an SQL-injection vulnerability in the inpector's node_cache.find_node(). This function makes an SQL query using unescaped data received on the wire from a server reporting inspection results (specifically, via a POST to the /v1/continue endpoint).
The unescaped data should not be trusted - the API is unauthenticated and it's likely that anything with access to the network on which ironic-inspector is listening could exploit the vulnerability.
Because of how the results of the query are used, there appears to be no way to exploit this vulnerability to exfiltrate data. It could be exploited for destructive ends by passing malicious data (e.g. "\'; DROP DATABASE;\'").
Every release from RHOS 8 on is affected.
