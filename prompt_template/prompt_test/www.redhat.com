Update Information:

Several bugs were found in the way Firefox processes
malformed javascript. A malicious web page could modify the
content of a different open web page, possibly stealing
sensitive information or conducting a cross-site scripting
attack. (CVE-2006-1731, CVE-2006-1732, CVE-2006-1741)

Several bugs were found in the way Firefox processes certain
javascript actions. A malicious web page could execute
arbitrary javascript instructions with the permissions of
"chrome", allowing the page to steal sensitive information
or install browser malware. (CVE-2006-1727, CVE-2006-1728,
CVE-2006-1733, CVE-2006-1734, CVE-2006-1735, CVE-2006-1742)

Several bugs were found in the way Firefox processes
malformed web pages. A carefully crafted malicious web page
could cause the execution of arbitrary code as the user
running Firefox. (CVE-2006-0749, CVE-2006-1724,
CVE-2006-1730, CVE-2006-1737, CVE-2006-1738, CVE-2006-1739,
CVE-2006-1790) 

A bug was found in the way Firefox displays the secure site
icon. If a browser is configured to display the non-default
secure site modal warning dialog, it may be possible to
trick a user into believing they are viewing a secure site.
(CVE-2006-1740)

A bug was found in the way Firefox allows javascript
mutation events on "input" form elements. A malicious web
page could be created in such a way that when a user submits
a form, an arbitrary file could be uploaded to the attacker.
