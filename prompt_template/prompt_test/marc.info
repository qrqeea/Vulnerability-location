Package:             tetex
Vulnerability:       remote command execution
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Dependent Packages:  none

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:       Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG 1.0          <= tetex-1.0.7-1.0.0     >= tetex-1.0.7-1.0.1
OpenPKG 1.1          <= tetex-1.0.7-1.1.0     >= tetex-1.0.7-1.1.1
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= tetex-1.0.7-20021204  >= tetex-1.0.7-20021216

Description:
  A vulnerability [1] in the kpathsea(3) library of teTeX was
  discovered. This library is used by xdvi(1) and dvips(1). Both
  programs call the system(3) function insecurely, which allows a remote
  attacker to execute arbitrary commands via cleverly crafted DVI files.
  If dvips(1) is used in a print filter, this allows a local or remote
  attacker with print permission execute arbitrary code as the printing
  system user.

  Check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm -q tetex".
  If you have an affected version of the samba package (see above),
  please upgrade it according to the solution below.

Solution:
  Update existing packages to newly patched versions of teTeX. Select the
  updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release [2][3][4], and
  fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service or a mirror location. Verify its
  integrity [5], build a corresponding binary RPM from it and update your
  OpenPKG installation by applying the binary RPM [6]. For the latest
  OpenPKG 1.1 release, perform the following operations to permanently fix
  the security problem (for other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/1.1/UPD
  ftp> get tetex-1.0.7-1.1.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm -v --checksig tetex-1.0.7-1.1.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm --rebuild tetex-1.0.7-1.1.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/tetex-1.0.7-1.1.1.*.rpm
