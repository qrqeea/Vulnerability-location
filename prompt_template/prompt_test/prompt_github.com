I will give you some information about the content of posts discussing software vulnerabilities. The information includes these parts: title and content, followed by {Title} and {Content} respectively. You need to extract the valuable parts from the information. The focus is on the information section describing the vulnerability. If the content section contains insufficient information to extract valuable details about the vulnerability, the output should be "no results".

{Title}:
Unauthenticated Blind SQL injection

Hi,
I want to report a critical vulnerability in Admidio management system. Can you please start a security advisory in the security section and add me to it, so we can discuss the vulnerability privately?

Atenetion: If the content section contains insufficient information to extract valuable details about the vulnerability, the output should be "no results". Do not output redundant prompt information, only output "no results".
