Synopsis
LCE 4.8.1 is possibly impacted by multiple vulnerabilities reported in third-party libraries. Tenable has not investigated each one to determine if it is exploitable or the vulnerable code path can be reached. Instead, Dev has upgraded the impacted libraries as a faster and safer alternative. Due to the number of library upgrades and the potential for any of these issues to impact LCE users, we strongly encourage you to upgrade. In some cases, older versions than 4.8.0 may be impacted by a subset of these issues.
The following vulnerabilities have been resolved with the updated libraries. Note that several of these issues do not have a CVE assigned.
SQLite ATTACH / DETACH Statement Handling NULL Pointer Dereference DoS
curl IDNA Puny Code Translation Incorrect Host Resolution Weakness
curl tool_urlglob.c Globbing Feature Out-of-bounds Access Issues
curl lib/escape.c curl_easy_unescape() Function URL Unescape Integer Truncation Heap Buffer Overflow

Note that the CVSSv2 score associated with this advisory is specific to the cURL / libcurl integration into LCE and assumes a worst-case scenario. These updates are proactive; Tenable has had no reports of exploitation and some of these issues may not impact LCE at all. Please note that Tenable strongly recommends that LCE be installed on a subnet that is not Internet addressable.
Solution
Log Correlation Engine (LCE) 4.8.2 has been released, which updates the linked OpenSSL, cURL / libcurl, and SQLite libraries. The new version can be obtained on the Tenable Support Portal.
