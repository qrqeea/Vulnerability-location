I'm researching vulnerabilities in the NVD database. Many vulnerability descriptions have too little information. I need you to help me complete the description. I will give you three parts of information, the first part is the original description, the second part is a template for completing the description, and the third part is reference information. They follow {original description}, {template}, {information} respectively. Please note that the reference information may not be accurate. You need to extract as much useful and accurate information as possible, and then follow the template to complete the description. The description of the completion should not be too long and should be a complete paragraph.

{original description}:
{#original description#}


{template}:
The [DESCRIPTION] field is a plain language field that should describe the vulnerability with sufficient detail as to demonstrate that the vulnerability is unique. The required information listed above should be included in the [DESCRIPTION], as well as other details the author feels are relevant or necessary to show uniqueness.
Specifically, the [DESCRIPTION] field could also include: An explanation of an attack type using the vulnerability; The impact of the vulnerability;The software components within a software product that are affected by the vulnerability; and Any attack vectors that can make use of the vulnerability.
Descriptions often follow this template:
     [PROBLEM TYPE] in [PRODUCT/VERSION] causes [IMPACT] when [ATTACK]
where impact and attack are arbitrary terms that should be relevant to the nature of the vulnerability.
